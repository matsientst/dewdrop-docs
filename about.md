Dewdrop was written by me (Matt Macchia) and many other fine folks who I'd like to acknowledge for their help and support in creating this library.


First, I want to thank Chris Condron at Event Store, and Josh Kempner at PerkinElmer for their expertise and guidance in creating the Dewdrop client library. A lot of the basis of Dewdrop was inspired by the [reactive-domain](https://github.com/ReactiveDomain/reactive-domain) project built in C# by both Chris and Josh.
Second, I want to thank Tom Friedhof, Kurtis Moffett, and Ryan Hartman for their contributions and effort in creating Dewdrop.

Thanks Guys!
